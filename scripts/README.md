# Migradion Scripts
In this folder you can find the scripts used to migrate from the SQL Warehouse to NO-SQL warehouses (Cassandra, MongoDB). 

## cassandra_scripts
It has two files:
* **SQL_TO_CQL.py**: It is used to transform and upload the data to cassandra through batch insertion statements. If used, do not forget to setup the proper usernames, passwords and cluster ips.
* **Workloads.py**: This script is used to perform queries against cassandra nodes and measure the time it takes to execute, evaluating the different replication factors established beforehand.

## mongo_scripts
* **SQL_TO_BSON.py**: It transforms the SQL data to a JSON-like representation. The main difference with the cassandra script is that it does not upload the data directly to mongo. The user must upload the data manually using the json files generated.

> The additional file in this repository **mongo_data.zip** contains a ready-to-use dataset generated by the mongo script.
